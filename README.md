# Project Title: Roadtrip Playlist

Team Members: 
Julie Shockley, Ovie Omene, Peter Fullen, Janessa Hanna 

Project Description: 
Our app is going to build a music playlist based on locations. The user will input a starting location and end location, then the app will generate a playlist based on the major cities in between the two cities. 

Sketch of Final Product:
Display current song playing and next in queue, display band information on current song, possibly  show the route between cities 

APIs to be Used:
* Google Maps
* Spotify (requires auth)
* Bands In Town

Rough Breakdown of Tasks:
* Initial screen layout with inputs - begin location and end location
* Container for playlist information and band information, potential 3rd container with map
* Buttons with options for screen views (toggle between map and playlist)
* Setup geolocation from Google Maps
* Pull locations from Google Maps info for input into BandInTown
* BandsInTown info feeds into Spotify API
* Generate playlist from Spotify data



Miscellaneous ideas:
* Trip Advisor
* News, Weather APIs
* Marvel
* Edamam (grocery store, Publix, WalMart)
* YouTube
* Sound Cloud
* Splash (random images)
